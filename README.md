##About Jerome

Jerome is a fork of the useful and well built Frank theme, created by [P.J. Onori](http://somerandomdude.com). I, [Jeremy Kolassa](http://jdkolassa.net), have found the Frank theme exceptionally useful as a base theme for my own projects. Unfortunately, it is a little out of date, now with Wordpress 4.3.1 is out with new functions. Jerome is intended to update Frank to new coding standards, replace deprecated functions, and maybe put a few tweaks in here and there. Naturally, it will strive to remain a lightweight theme focused on speed and the reading experience.

For more information, please see the [original readme with the Frank repository](https://github.com/somerandomdude/Frank). I will update this readme as I develop the theme further.

###Jerome is forward-thinking

Like Frank, Jerome is focused on using HTML5 and CSS3, and is not terribly concerned with backwards support for older browsers, such as older versions of Internet Explorer. Jerome will not include support for IE6, IE7, and will have only moderate support for IE8. 

###Jerome is mobile

Jerome uses part of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) to provide a responsive layout all devices. 

###Jerome is open source

Just like Frank, Jerome will be released under the [GNU Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

##Browser Compatibility
Jerome is focused on modern desktop and mobile browser support. It'll work okay, maybe, with IE8. It won't work with anything before that, and won't be designed to.

##WordPress Compatibility
Jerome is being built on Wordpress 4.3.1, and is intended to be compatible with 4.x versions.
